Some examples for comparing scoobi vs hand written performance.

Currently running examples:
examples.wikilog.WikipediaLog

This project contains 3 folders:
- manual: The hand written programs, which should resemble what our DSL will output
- scoobi: The same programs written with scoobi
- benchmark: Some helper scripts to compile, run, collect and interpret the results

Installation:
1) Download the test data sets. They are listed in testdatas.txt
2) I used milliseconds for more exact times. compare.py currently expects those kind of timestamps.
Either:
	- Use the provided log4j.properties used by hadoop
	- Only change the timestamp format in log4j.properties used by hadoop
	- Change compare.py to recognize desired format for the timestamp
3) I use a different version of scoobi, which does not override the default progress reporter. Otherwise the Total written and read sizes are not reported. See my github repository.

Basic usage is this:
- Change the programs in scoobi and manual. Make sure they are in the same package and are named the same.
- within benchmark folder:
	- run compile.sh. This will create the jars for both programs and put them in progs, as manual.jar and scoobi.jar
	- run run.sh. First argument is the input folder, second one is the output folder. Additional program specific arguments can be given. This will:
		- Clear the output folder
		- Run the manual programs, show the total time and the total output size on the console
		- Collect system.err in manual.txt or scoobi.txt, respectively
	- run copy.sh, first argument is used as an addon to the filename. The manual.txt and scoobi.txt will be copied to the results folder.
	- run compare.py, which creates a table. Might be later extended to create plots again.

Change whatever you need.
